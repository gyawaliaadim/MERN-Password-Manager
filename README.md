Password Manager made with MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS)

# Installation ðŸš€

Make sure you have Node js, and MongoDB extension installed in your computer and VS Code respectively

First clone this git:
```
git clone {url}
```
You will find two folders:<br>
root<br>
â”‚<br>
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend<br>
â”œâ”€â”€ backend<br>

Open two terminals:
Terminal 1:

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
*Installs all the dependencies*
$ npm run dev

> MERN-Password-Manager@0.0.0 dev
> vite

2:06:26 AM [vite] (client) Re-optimizing dependencies because vite config has changed

  VITE v6.2.5  ready in 1809 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
  âžœ  press h + enter to show help
```
Go the the port, for my case its http://localhost:5173/


Terminal 2:
```
$ cd backend
$ npm install
*Installs all the dependencies*
$ node server.js
Server Active at: http://localhost:3000
```

Now open your MongoDB Compass or its extension in VS Code and connect it to mongodb://localhost:27017/ 
If you Database is using different port then you can change it in:<br>
backend<br>
â”‚<br>
â”œâ”€â”€ .env<br>
<br>
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:(your port)
DB_NAME=PassManager
```

Now you are good to go, Open the url in the first terminal in your browser and use the app.

It is my first full stack MERN project, simple but tricky. I hope I continue my journey learning even more. You can follow me on my github and linkedin to be in this journey.<br>
<br>
Till then goodbye ðŸ˜€
